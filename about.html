      <h2 class="text-center">Vision</h2>
      <p class="text-justify panda-text">One year after giant pandas graduated from endangered to “vulnerable,” a welcome designation after 28 years, Chinese scientists have sobering news: The animal’s natural habitat in China is in serious danger.

      In a study published in Nature Ecology & Evolution on Monday, researchers report that suitable panda habitats have significantly and steadily declined since 1990, the year the International Union for the Conservation of Nature first classified the animals as endangered. That could make any gain in China’s wild panda population a short-lived conservation victory.

      Logging, human encroachment, road construction and agriculture have conspired to divide panda habitats into tiny sections, a process known as fragmentation, the study said.

      Ouyang Zhiyun, a professor of environmental science at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and his colleagues studied 40 years of satellite data to reach their conclusions, and are urging the Chinese government to take specific steps to restore panda-friendly environments.

      Giant pandas are a national icon of China, the only place in the world where they live outside of captivity.

     <strong><p class="text-his parallax text-justify">
       Public Benefit– All our projects, whether using communal or micro-entrepreneurial models, are geared towards providing the maximum benefit and are charitable in intent and structure.</p>
      <p class="text-his parallax text-justify">
       Project Orientation– Our work concentrates directly on the design, development, and construction of community-based renewable energy systems associated with residential electricity, economic development, potable water and watershed protection.</p>
      <p class="text-his parallax text-justify">
       Technology– We support community-based renewable energy projects that utilize small hydropower, biomass, biogas, wind and solar technology designed, built, and maintained locally.</p>
       <p class="text-his parallax text-justify">
       Social Justice– Projects must have the maximum positive impact on basic human rights such as employment, health, education, personal opportunity and other indicators of a healthy society. We also feel that for projects to be successful, both men and women must be actively involved in the development of their community renewable energy system.</p>
       <p class="text-his parallax text-justify">
       Local Leadership– We support projects that have strong community backing and leadership. Local people are trained in the skills necessary to operate and maintain their projects. We promote the leadership of local technical NGO organizations, as their skills are vital to the planning and building of the projects.</p>
       <p class="text-his parallax text-justify">
       Sustainability– Our goal is to ensure that the projects become self-sufficient soon. Each project must have a plan for long-term sustainability, both economically and environmentally. Rural electrification is supported by community tariffs for residential use of electricity as well as micro-enterprises that generate revenue for the long-term viability of the projects.</p>
       <p class="text-his parallax text-justify">
       Environmental Impact– The projects we support must include a strong environmental component. Watershed protection and community environmental planning which promotes conservation and restoration are integral to our work.
